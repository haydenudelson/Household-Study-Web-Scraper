STUDY_ABSTRACT = "Household definitions used in multi-topic household surveys vary between surveys but have \
                  potentially significant implications for household composition, production, and poverty statistics. \
                  Standard definitions of the household usually include some intersection of keywords relating to \
                  residency requirements, common food consumption, and intermingling of income or production decisions.\
                  Despite best practices intending to standardize the definition of the household, it is unclear which \
                  types of definitions or which intersections of keywords in a definition result in different household \
                  compositions. We would like to compare many different household surveys, and their household \
                  composition definitions, with the resulting data from the study to see how these different definitions \
                  impact the data output itself."
